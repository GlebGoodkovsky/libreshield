## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important User Information

### Data Handling & Security

LibreShield is built with privacy as a core principle. All your settings are stored locally in your browser's own secure storage.

- **Strong Password Protection** üîí: Your settings are secured by a password. This password is **never stored directly**. Instead, it's protected using a strong cryptographic hashing function (**PBKDF2 with a 100,000-iteration SHA-256 hash and a random salt**). This industry-standard method makes it extremely difficult for anyone to access your settings without the correct password.
- **No Cloud Storage** ‚òÅÔ∏è: Your data **never leaves your computer** and is never sent to any external servers. Your privacy is paramount.
- **Privacy Policy** üìú: For a detailed breakdown of permissions and data handling, please see the [PRIVACY.md](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=.%2FPRIVACY.md) file included in this repository.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (Tech Stack)

LibreShield is built using core web technologies and the powerful WebExtensions API:
- **HTML**: Structures the user interfaces for the options, popup, and block pages.
- **CSS**: Styles the entire extension, including responsive design and theme management.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)**: Powers all the interactive logic, including:
    - `background.js:` Manages web request blocking, password verification, and temporary unblock timers.
    - `content.js:` Handles on-page keyword scanning and communicates with the background script.
    - **UI Logic**: Manages the options page, popup interactions, and the block page.
- **WebExtensions API (`browser`.)**: The browser-provided API for `storage`, `webRequest`, `tabs`, and `runtime` features, which are the backbone of the extension's functionality.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Install the Extension**
    - **From Source (for Developers)**: Follow the "Running Locally" steps below.
    - **(Future) From Official Stores**: Links to the Firefox Add-ons store will be provided here once it's officially published.
2. **Set Your Password**
    - The first time you open the settings page, you will be required to create a password. This keeps your rules and settings secure.
3. **Manage Settings**
    - Click the "Manage Settings" button in the popup to open the main options page.
    - **Manage Lists**: Add or remove items from your Blocked Domains, Blocked Keywords, and Allowed Sites lists.
    - **Customize**: Change the message shown on the block page and switch between light and dark themes.
    - **Backup/Restore**: Export your settings to a file for safekeeping.
4. **Encountering a Blocked Page**
    - If you land on a page that is blocked, you will see the LibreShield block screen.
    - If you need temporary access, you can enter your password and specify a duration (in minutes) to bypass the block.

## A Note on the Learning Process

This project was created as a hands-on exercise to develop a full-featured browser extension. It demonstrates core concepts of WebExtension development, including background scripts, content scripts, user interfaces, and persistent storage. The goal was to build a simple, understandable, yet fully functional content blocker. I used an AI assistant as a tool to help write and, more importantly, explain the code, using it as a learning partner to grasp fundamentals step-by-step.
